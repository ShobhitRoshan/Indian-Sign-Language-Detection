# Indian-Sign-Language-Detection
This repository contains code that can detect the Indian Sign Languages using Deep Learning models and OpenCV.

This is a python implementation for detecting sign languages using OpenCV and tensorflow models. I created my own dataset and implemented Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model to train on the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1INUl_fW8ODNcGb9aZ0adMNJOcIZjqYil?usp=sharing). I used OpenCV to generate ROI(Region Of Intrest) to capture hand image and used that image to predict the sign using CNN model.

Using this method, the model gave 87% accuracy approx. on the test data.
